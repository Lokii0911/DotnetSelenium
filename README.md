# Dotnet Selenium
This project is a Selenium-based automation framework developed in C# using NUnit, following the Page Object Model (POM) with inheritance to ensure clean and maintainable test code. It automates key HRM workflows including login, punch in/out attendance tracking, and employee addition. The framework uses WebDriverWait for reliable synchronization to handle click interception issues, and extension methods to improve element handling.

The framework now also includes ExtentReports HTML reporting with embedded screenshots for failed tests, providing a clear visual report of test execution results. Reports are generated automatically in the TestReports folder after each run, offering detailed insights into test steps, pass/fail status, stack traces, and visual proof of failures.

Designed as a hands-on learning project, it demonstrates real-world automation concepts like modular test design, reusable page classes, robust assertion strategies for validating UI behaviors, and professional-grade reporting for test result analysis.
