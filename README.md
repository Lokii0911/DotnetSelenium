# Dotnet Selenium
This project is a Selenium-based automation framework developed in C# using NUnit, following the Page Object Model (POM) with inheritance to ensure clean and maintainable test code. It automates key HRM workflows including login, punch in/out attendance tracking, and employee addition. The framework uses WebDriverWait for reliable synchronization to handle click interception issues, and extension methods to improve element handling. Designed as a hands-on learning project, it demonstrates real-world automation concepts like modular test design, reusable page classes, and robust assertion strategies for validating UI behaviors.
